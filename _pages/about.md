Hey! I'm a Python/C++ quantitative developer fascinated by the intersection of software engineering, mathematics, and finance. I earned my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Warwick University and went on to complete a master's in Mathematical and Computational Finance at Oxford University. These studies helped shaped my understanding of how technology and quantitative analysis come together in practical ways, and I'm enthusiastic about applying these skills to solve real-world challenges in both the finance and tech sectors. 

Welcome to my personal page, where I showcase my portfolio and share occasional musings on the joys and challenges of Python and C++. Explore how Python simplifies development effortlessly, while C++ often outpaces Python in terms of speed (thanks, GIL!). Expect periodic (or rather, stochastic) dives into topics related to volatility. Stay tuned for updates!

A short Python puzzle to get us acquainted:
```python
f = lambda i: i
g = f
print(g(1))
g = lambda x: g(x) + 1
print(g(1))
```
What should we expect the output of this code to be?
