Hi! I'm a developer with a keen interest in software engineering, mathematics, finance. I'm particularly passionate about delving into solutions for problems within the intersection of these domains. 

Welcome to my personal page, a curated space where I host my portfolio and occasionally muse on the intricacies and nuances of Python and C++. Uncover the elegance of Python's development simplicity and the superior performance of C++ (thanks to the Python GIL!). Anticipate periodic (or perhaps stochastic?) explorations into topics such as volatility. Don't hesitate to reach out if you find any of this interesting!

A short Python puzzle to get us acquainted:
```python
f = lambda i: i
g = f
print(g(1))
g = lambda x: g(x) + 1
print(g(1))
```
What should we expect the output of this code to be?
