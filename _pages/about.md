I'm a Python/C++ quantitative developer with interests spanning across software engineering and maths, and finance. Stay to hear to some rants about how Python is so much easier to write than C++, or how much faster C++ is than Python (looking at you, GIL!).

Before you go, here's a short Python puzzle for you:
```python
f = lambda i: i
g = f
g = lambda x: g(x) + 1
print(g(1))
```
What goes wrong, why does it go wrong and how would you fix it without changing the (non-default) function signature of `g`?
