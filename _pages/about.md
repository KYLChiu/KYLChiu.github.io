Hi! I'm a Python/C++ quantitative developer with interests spanning across software engineering, mathematics and finance. I completed a bachelors degree in Mathematics from Warwick University and a masters degree in Mathematical and Computational Finance from Oxford University.

Stay tuned for occasional rants about the joys and frustrations of Python and C++. You'll hear about how Python makes development a breeze compared to C++, and how C++ usually runs circles around Python in terms of speed (thanks, GIL!). And don't be surprised if I occasionally (or should I say stochastically) dive into a topic related to volatility.

A short Python puzzle to get us acquainted:
```python
f = lambda i: i
g = f
g = lambda x: g(x) + 1
print(g(1))
```
What should we expect from this excerpt?
