Project Euler is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems designed to be solved using computer programs. Founded in 2001 by Colin Hughes, the project appeals to adults and students alike who are interested in mathematics and computer programming. It has gained global recognition and popularity, featuring over 600 problems, with a new one added weekly (excluding summers). The problems increase in difficulty progressively, yet each is solvable in under a minute using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer.
