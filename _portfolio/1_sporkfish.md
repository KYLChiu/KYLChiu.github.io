Sporkfish is a Python-based chess engine. Chess programming techniques, although numerous, are not always well-documented. This project aims to bridge that gap by offering clear, working, and accessible code, providing a resource for developers interested in understanding and implementing chess engine algorithms.

The name "Sporkfish" is a playful nod to Stockfish, currently the strongest chess engine (at the time of writing). It combines the fork move type (simultaneously attacking two pieces) with fish. Originally, we intended to use "Forkfish", but this name was already taken on Lichess, so we opted for "Sporkfish" instead.
