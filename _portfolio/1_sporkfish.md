Sporkfish is a Python-based chess engine. Chess programming techniques, although numerous, are not always well-documented. This project aims to bridge that gap by offering clear, working, and accessible code, providing a resource for developers interested in understanding and implementing chess engine algorithms.

The name is a play on *Stockfish* which is currently the strongest chess engine (at the time of writing), combining the *fork* move type (hitting two pieces at once) and *fish*. However this name was already taken on Lichess so we went with *Sporkfish* instead.
